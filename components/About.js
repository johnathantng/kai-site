                    I am a Rhode Island School of Design graduate with a passion 
                    for UI/UX design and branding identities. I love creating 
                    experiences for people through innovative design and products.

                    Throughout the course of my education and work experiences, 
                    I have developed an interdisciplinary skillset that allows me to 
                    design solutions to problems in an effective and empathetic way.

                    When I'm not working, I enjoy illustrating, creating mood boards
                    and watching cat videos on YouTube.
